			<p style="text-align:justify"> <b> <u>SECIOTT</u> The IOT devices are rapidly becoming ubiquitous for their ability to effortlessly automate processes by interconnecting smart devices without human intervention. These devices collect data from the most private and sensitive domains of our lives and send to the cloud services for management and further processing including the rule-based automation programs. The cloud services are vulnerable to outside threats, which could cause serious user privacy violations as well as user safety risks leading to unrecoverable loses. Hence, itâ€™s essential to protect the sensitive and private IOT data and rule-based automation programs against different cyberattacks. To safeguard this sensitive and private IOT data, solutions based on trusted execution environments (TEEs) could be utilized, providing end-to-end encrypted solution. However, in this study, we demonstrate that the end-to-end encryption offered by TEE based solutions for IOT devices may not be entirely sufficient. We substantiate this by revealing an attack that can infer sensitive IOT device information, such as the temperature reading of a thermometer, merely by analyzing memory access patterns of the TEE based solution. Our results indicate that in some cases, we can detect the device type with around 95% accuracy and we can infer the values sent by IOT devices (e.g., temperature reading) with approximately 85% accuracy. Subsequently, we design a system called SECIOTT to enhance the overall data security of IOT based solutions in the cloud that prevents these types of attacks by employing strategies such as oblivious execution and data padding. With our defense strategy to mitigate the pattern leakage, we observe significant reduction in device type detection and value prediction with accuracy of at most 27% and 19%, respectively. </b> </p>

					<h2> <b> Conclusion </b> </h2>
					<!-- your education -->
                    <hr style="text-align:justify"> <b> Since the IOT ecosystem is ever-growing, more robust solutions are required to protect private and sensitive user information from falling into the wrong hands. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end secure IOT data management platform, named SECIOTT, by utilizing strong cryptographic techniques and TEEs such as INTEL SGX and ARM TRUST-ZONE. We implement a trigger-action rule-based IOT automation framework as an application of SECIOTT, where we securely operate on the IOT data and rules in the SGX enclave to automate processes for securely controlling and managing IOT devices. We evaluate SECIOTT with IOT data in real-time from real smart devices in a practical smart home scenario. Moreover, we investigate the effect of access pattern leakage attack on SGX and discover that sensitive IoT information can be inferred with notable accuracy, which demonstrates that end-to-end encryption-based TEE solutions are not adequate to safeguard private information. Consequently, we propose countermeasures based on oblivious execution and data padding to obscure the access pattern leakages. Our empirical evaluation suggests that the proposed defense strategy achieves impressive results by significantly reducing the prediction accuracy of IOT data information, and thereby further fortifying the encryption-based TEE solutions and ensuring system security and data privacy. </b></hr>
